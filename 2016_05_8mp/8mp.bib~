abstract = {The world’s leading internationally connected cities (“global cities”) host a disproportional share of skilled workers, innovative companies and high quality public and private institutions, but yet their role as innovation hubs in international R{\&}D networks has been underexposed. In this paper we examine how characteristics of global cities’ innovation systems attract or discourage R{\&}D investments by multinational firms. An analysis of location decisions for 971 cross-border R{\&}D investments in 50 global cities during 2003- 2012 confirms the significance of cities’ specialized technological strengths, international inventor connectivity, and the strengths of local universities as key attractors of R{\&}D. Wage costs strongly discourage R{\&}D investments, while political and social stability facilitates R{\&}D. The role of university strength is substantially more pronounced for research investments, but market potential (GDP and GDP growth) attract development projects.},

@article{hidalgo2009,
abstract = {For Adam Smith, wealth was related to the division of labor. As people and firms specialize in different activities, economic efficiency increases, suggesting that development is associated with an increase in the number of individual activities and with the complexity that emerges from the interactions between them. Here we develop a view of economic growth and development that gives a central role to the complexity of a country's economy by interpreting trade data as a bipartite network in which countries are connected to the products they export, and show that it is possible to quantify the complexity of a country's economy by characterizing the structure of this network. Furthermore, we show that the measures of complexity we derive are correlated with a country's level of income, and that deviations from this relationship are predictive of future growth. This suggests that countries tend to converge to the level of income dictated by the complexity of their productive structures, indicating that development efforts should focus on generating the conditions that would allow complexity to emerge to generate sustained growth and prosperity. },

abstract = {The mutual influence of smoking behavior and friendships in adolescence is studied. It is attempted to disentangle influence and selection processes in reciprocal and non-reciprocal friendships. An actor-based model is described for the co-evolution of friendship networks and smoking behavior. This model considers alternative selection and influence mechanisms, and models continuous-time changes in network and behavior. The data consists of a longitudinal sample of 1326 Finnish adolescents in 11 high schools. Findings suggest that selection as well as influence processes play an important role in adolescent smoking behavior. Selection had a relatively stronger role than influence, in particular when selecting non-reciprocal friends. The strength of both influence and selection processes decreased over time. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Allen1974,
abstract = {Interorganizational elite cooptation, in the form of interlocking corporate directorates, is viewed as a cooperative strategy between economic organizations for reducing sources of uncertainty in their environments. Specifically, corporate interlocking is a means of anticipating or controlling sources of uncertainty stemming from the potentially disruptive unilateral actions of other corporations. In order to examine the relevant hypotheses, two comparable samples are constructed comprising the 200 largest nonfinancial and the 50 largest financial corporations as ranked by their assets for the periods 1935 and 1970. As hypothesized, the size of a corporation is directly related to the frequency of interlocking in general, even controlling for the size of its directorate. Also, financial corporations maintain more interlocks in general than nonfinancial corporations due to the importance of capital as a resource. Contrary to the theory, there is no clear relationship between such organizational characteristics as capital intensity and growth and the frequency of interlocking with financial corporations; moreover, there is even a significant negative relationship between dependency on external debt obligations and frequency of financial interlocking. As hypothesized, corporations with local market environments maintain a greater proportion of their interlocks at the local level than other corporations. Also, the structure of corporate interlocking has become more diffuse through time with a smaller proportion of the interlocksbeing maintained at the local level. However, contrary to the theory, the frequency of interlocking with financial corporations has increased rather than decreased through time.},

The technology, capital, institutions, and skills needed to make newer products are more easily adapted from some products than from others. Here, we study this network of relatedness between products, or "product space," finding that more-sophisticated products are located in a densely connected core whereas less-sophisticated products occupy a less-connected periphery. Empirically, countries move through the product space by developing goods close to those they currently produce. Most countries can reach the core only by traversing empirically infrequent distances, which may help explain why poor countries have trouble developing more competitive exports and fail to converge to the income levels of rich countries.},

Special attention is paid to the processual formulations implied by various interlock analyses.

@article{Epstein2006,
abstract = {This article argues that the agent-based computational model permits a distinctive approach to social science for which the term generative is suitable. In defending this terminology, features distinguishing the approach from both inductive and deductive science are given. Then, the following specific contributions to social science are discussed: The agent-based computational model is a new tool for empirical research. It offers a natural environment for the study of connectionist phenomena in social science. Agent-based modeling pro- vides a powerful way to address certain enduringand especially interdisciplinaryquestions. It allows one to subject certain core theoriessuch as neoclassical microeconomicsto important types of stress (e.g., the effect of evolving preferences). It permits one to study how rules of individual behavior give riseor map upto macroscopic regularities and organizations. In turn, one can employ laboratory behavioral research findings to select among competing agent-based (bottom up) models. The agent-based approach may well have the important effect of decoupling individual rationality from macroscopic equilibrium and of separating decision science from social science more generally. Agent-based modeling offers powerful new forms of hybrid theo- retical-computational work; these are particularly relevant to the study of non-equilibrium systems. The agent- based approach invites the interpretation of society as a distributed computational device, and in turn the interpretation of social dynamics as a type of computation. This interpretation raises important foundational issues in social sciencesome related to intractability, and some to undecidability proper. Finally, since emer- gence figures prominently in this literature, I take up the connection between agent-based modeling and classical emergentism, criticizing the latter and arguing that the two are incompatible. 1999 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

abstract = {The faculty job market plays a fundamental role in shaping research priorities, educational outcomes, and career trajectories among scientists and institutions. However, a quantitative understanding of faculty hiring as a system is lacking. Using a simple technique to extract the institutional prestige ranking that best explains an observed faculty hiring network—who hires whose graduates as faculty—we present and analyze comprehensive placement data on nearly 19,000 regular faculty in three disparate disciplines. Across disciplines, we find that faculty hiring follows a common and steeply hierarchical structure that reflects profound social inequality. Furthermore, doctoral prestige alone better predicts ultimate placement than a U.S. News {\&} World Report rank, women generally place worse than men, and increased institutional prestige leads to increased faculty production, better faculty placement, and a more influential position within the discipline. These results advance our ability to quantify the influence of prestige in academia and shed new light on the academic system.},
