Graham Morbey reports on results of this study of R{\&}D spending of major US companies for the ten-year period 1976 to 1985, including possibly controversial inferences concerning the relationship between R{\&}D and company performance. He finds a strong association between R{\&}D spending and subsequent growth in sales. However, he detects a threshold R{\&}D funding level which must be exceeded if R{\&}D is to contribute to future sales growth. The study shows little correlation between R{\&}D intensity and growth in profitability. Also, it is apparent that sales growth and increasing profitability do not lead to increased allocations for R{\&}D in most industries. ?? 1988.},

It relates the differential sales growth rates of the gaining and losing firms to national trends in industrial competitiveness, to employment change and to long-term returns to shareholders. One principal determinant of firms' global growth rates, and thence gains and losses in `world market share', corporate research and development (R{\&}D) intensity, is examined and tested on an 83-firm, six-industry subset of the overall data base. The proportion of corporate sales revenues allocated to commercially oriented R{\&}D emerges as a, perhaps the, principal indicator of subsequent sales growth performance relative to competition over 5-10-year periods. Insofar as many U.S. and U.K. firms have lost global market share relative to Asian and European competitors over the past two decades, a significant contributory factor would appear to have been negligence on the part of many U.S. and U.K. firms of investment in technology as a factor determining strategic, competitive advantage.},

Nine out of ten hypotheses received support, with results showing that firms engaging in acquisitions and divestitures emphasize financial controls, deemphasize strategic controls, and thereby produce less internal innovation. Furthermore, these firms are likely to seek external innovation to gain short-term benefits in competitive advantage. We conclude that engaging in the market for corporate control strongly affects the context in which innovation is framed, the control mechanisms employed, and the design and process of innovation.},

An analysis of location decisions for 971 cross-border R{\&}D investments in 50 global cities during 2003- 2012 confirms the significance of cities’ specialized technological strengths, international inventor connectivity, and the strengths of local universities as key attractors of R{\&}D.

The role of university strength is substantially more pronounced for research investments, but market potential (GDP and GDP growth) attract development projects.},

@article{hidalgo2009,
abstract = {For Adam Smith, wealth was related to the division of labor. As people and firms specialize in different activities, economic efficiency increases, suggesting that development is associated with an increase in the number of individual activities and with the complexity that emerges from the interactions between them. Here we develop a view of economic growth and development that gives a central role to the complexity of a country's economy by interpreting trade data as a bipartite network in which countries are connected to the products they export, and show that it is possible to quantify the complexity of a country's economy by characterizing the structure of this network. Furthermore, we show that the measures of complexity we derive are correlated with a country's level of income, and that deviations from this relationship are predictive of future growth. This suggests that countries tend to converge to the level of income dictated by the complexity of their productive structures, indicating that development efforts should focus on generating the conditions that would allow complexity to emerge to generate sustained growth and prosperity. },

It is attempted to disentangle influence and selection processes in reciprocal and non-reciprocal friendships. An actor-based model is described for the co-evolution of friendship networks and smoking behavior. This model considers alternative selection and influence mechanisms, and models continuous-time changes in network and behavior. The data consists of a longitudinal sample of 1326 Finnish adolescents in 11 high schools. Findings suggest that selection as well as influence processes play an important role in adolescent smoking behavior. Selection had a relatively stronger role than influence, in particular when selecting non-reciprocal friends. The strength of both influence and selection processes decreased over time. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Allen1974,
abstract = {Interorganizational elite cooptation, in the form of interlocking corporate directorates, is viewed as a cooperative strategy between economic organizations for reducing sources of uncertainty in their environments. Specifically, corporate interlocking is a means of anticipating or controlling sources of uncertainty stemming from the potentially disruptive unilateral actions of other corporations. In order to examine the relevant hypotheses, two comparable samples are constructed comprising the 200 largest nonfinancial and the 50 largest financial corporations as ranked by their assets for the periods 1935 and 1970. As hypothesized, the size of a corporation is directly related to the frequency of interlocking in general, even controlling for the size of its directorate. Also, financial corporations maintain more interlocks in general than nonfinancial corporations due to the importance of capital as a resource. Contrary to the theory, there is no clear relationship between such organizational characteristics as capital intensity and growth and the frequency of interlocking with financial corporations; moreover, there is even a significant negative relationship between dependency on external debt obligations and frequency of financial interlocking. As hypothesized, corporations with local market environments maintain a greater proportion of their interlocks at the local level than other corporations. Also, the structure of corporate interlocking has become more diffuse through time with a smaller proportion of the interlocksbeing maintained at the local level. However, contrary to the theory, the frequency of interlocking with financial corporations has increased rather than decreased through time.},

abstract = {We perform sensitivity analyses to assess the impact of missing data on the structural properties of social networks. The social network is conceived of as being generated by a bipartite graph, in which actors are linked together via multiple interaction contexts or affiliations. We discuss three principal missing data mechanisms: network boundary specification (non-inclusion of actors or affiliations), survey non-response, and censoring by vertex degree (fixed choice design), examining their impact on the scientific collaboration network from the Los Alamos E-print Archive as well as random bipartite graphs. The simulation results show that network boundary specification and fixed choice designs can dramatically alter estimates of network-level statistics. The observed clustering and assortativity coefficients are overestimated via omission of affiliations or fixed choice thereof, and underestimated via actor non-response, which results in inflated measurement error. We also find that social networks with multiple interaction contexts may have certain interesting properties due to the presence of overlapping cliques. In particular, assortativity by degree does not necessarily improve network robustness to random omission of nodes as predicted by current theory. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

A study of organizations that migrated from the NASDAQ stock market to the New York Stock Exchange reveals that strong ties to in-group members (NASDAQ members) reduced the impact of identity-discrepant cues and diminished defections. Conversely, strong ties to out-group members (NYSE members) enhanced the impact of identity-discrepant cues and increased defection. Proximity to defectors increased cross-overs-organizations followed defectors to whom they had direct ties. implications for the study of embeddedness are outlined.},

@article{hidalgo2007,
abstract = {Economies grow by upgrading the products they produce and export. The technology, capital, institutions, and skills needed to make newer products are more easily adapted from some products than from others. Here, we study this network of relatedness between products, or "product space," finding that more-sophisticated products are located in a densely connected core whereas less-sophisticated products occupy a less-connected periphery. Empirically, countries move through the product space by developing goods close to those they currently produce. Most countries can reach the core only by traversing empirically infrequent distances, which may help explain why poor countries have trouble developing more competitive exports and fail to converge to the income levels of rich countries.},

@article{Mizruchi1996,
abstract = {Research on interlocking directorates has gained increasing prominence within the field of organizations, but it has come under increasing criticism as well. This chapter presents an in-depth examination of the study of interlocking directorates. I focus initially on both the determinants and the consequences of interlocking directorates, reviewing alternative accounts of both phenomena. Special attention is paid to the processual formulations implied by various interlock analyses. I then address the two primary criticisms of interlock research and evaluate the tenability of these criticisms. I conclude with a discussion of future directions for interlock research.},

@article{Epstein2006,
abstract = {This article argues that the agent-based computational model permits a distinctive approach to social science for which the term generative is suitable. In defending this terminology, features distinguishing the approach from both inductive and deductive science are given. Then, the following specific contributions to social science are discussed: The agent-based computational model is a new tool for empirical research. It offers a natural environment for the study of connectionist phenomena in social science. Agent-based modeling pro- vides a powerful way to address certain enduringand especially interdisciplinaryquestions. It allows one to subject certain core theoriessuch as neoclassical microeconomicsto important types of stress (e.g., the effect of evolving preferences). It permits one to study how rules of individual behavior give riseor map upto macroscopic regularities and organizations. In turn, one can employ laboratory behavioral research findings to select among competing agent-based (bottom up) models. The agent-based approach may well have the important effect of decoupling individual rationality from macroscopic equilibrium and of separating decision science from social science more generally. Agent-based modeling offers powerful new forms of hybrid theo- retical-computational work; these are particularly relevant to the study of non-equilibrium systems. The agent- based approach invites the interpretation of society as a distributed computational device, and in turn the interpretation of social dynamics as a type of computation. This interpretation raises important foundational issues in social sciencesome related to intractability, and some to undecidability proper. Finally, since emer- gence figures prominently in this literature, I take up the connection between agent-based modeling and classical emergentism, criticizing the latter and arguing that the two are incompatible. 1999 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.},

@article{Clauset2015,
abstract = {The faculty job market plays a fundamental role in shaping research priorities, educational outcomes, and career trajectories among scientists and institutions. However, a quantitative understanding of faculty hiring as a system is lacking. Using a simple technique to extract the institutional prestige ranking that best explains an observed faculty hiring network—who hires whose graduates as faculty—we present and analyze comprehensive placement data on nearly 19,000 regular faculty in three disparate disciplines. Across disciplines, we find that faculty hiring follows a common and steeply hierarchical structure that reflects profound social inequality. Furthermore, doctoral prestige alone better predicts ultimate placement than a U.S. News {\&} World Report rank, women generally place worse than men, and increased institutional prestige leads to increased faculty production, better faculty placement, and a more influential position within the discipline. These results advance our ability to quantify the influence of prestige in academia and shed new light on the academic system.},
